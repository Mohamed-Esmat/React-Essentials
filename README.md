# React Essentials Demo App

## Overview

This is a demo web application built using React as part of the "React - The Complete Guide 2025 (incl. Next.js, Redux)" course by Maximilian Schwarzmüller. The project serves as an introduction to essential React concepts, including components, props, event handling, state management, and advanced patterns such as props forwarding and dynamic wrappers.

## Features

- **Component-Based Architecture**: The application is structured using reusable React components.
- **JSX Syntax**: Utilizes JSX to define the UI.
- **Props & Props Forwarding**: Passes data between components using props, including the `children` prop, and enhances reusability through props forwarding patterns.
- **Event Handling**: Listens to user interactions using event listeners.
- **State Management**: Implements `useState` to manage dynamic data and trigger UI updates.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Uses `if` statements, ternary operators, and logical operators to conditionally display content.
- **List Rendering**: Maps arrays to dynamically generate UI elements while ensuring efficient rendering with unique `key` props.
- **Dynamic Component Structure**: Supports flexible JSX slots for dynamic content rendering.
- **Customizable Element Wrappers**: Allows dynamic selection of wrapper elements for UI components.
- **Default Prop Values**: Provides sensible defaults to enhance usability and avoid unnecessary configuration.
